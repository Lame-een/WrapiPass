# WrapiPass
VariPass API wrapper for C++

### Features
Read and write functions for bool, int, float and string.

### Built with/using
  * Microsoft Visual Studio 2017  
  * [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se/)  
  * [VariPass](https://varipass.org/)

### What is VariPass
From [their website](https://varipass.org/):  
*"VariPass is a website designed to allow you to easily exchange variable data across the internet. Be it device to device, software to software or any combination in between, it is up to you to decide."*

(Note I am in no way affiliated with VariPass. I find their service interesting and easy to use and that's why I decided to make a proper C++ implementation for their API.)
